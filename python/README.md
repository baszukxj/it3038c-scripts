# Python Plugin Wikipedia

I (Xavier Baszuk) am using the plugin "wikipedia" for python scripting! This lab includes two files: the README and the script (which demonstrates 3 uses of the plugin).

# Uses

You can use the wikipedia plugin for a variety of things.

One use is the ability to search for wikipedia pages based on what you input. The returned results are wikipedia pages associated with the search. The wikipedia plugin also can you give you back the suggested result based on what you searched.

To add onto this, another use is the ability to see a summary of a certain page.

Another powerful use is the ability to pull different sections and meta data off of the page with the plugin.

# Install

To install the plugin, simply run the following command in your command prompt/terminal:

```
pip install Wikipedia
```

# Usage

To use the plugin in your python script, you will need to import it at the top of the script with the following line:

```
import wikipedia
```
